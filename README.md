Abduction Activity is my 1st year final project using Python language based on Object-oriented Programming. 

It is an original game that I came up with. This game was inspired by various unsolved mysteries referring to humans getting abducted by UFOs. The direction of the gameplay is quite simple; the player plays as the UFO whose lone purpose is to abduct as much humans as possible. Furthermore, this game has its own built-in database that keeps the player's account, password, highscores, UFO stats, skins, and coins of each individual player. In otherwords, there are items and upgradable stats in the shop that the player can buy inside the game itself.

Languages: Python
Modules: pygame, pickle, math, random
